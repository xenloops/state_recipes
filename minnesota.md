## Pan-Seared Walleye with Morel Cream Sauce and Honeycrisp Apple Salad

### Ingredients

    2 walleye fillets
    1 cup fresh morel mushrooms, sliced
    1 tablespoon butter
    1 cup milk
    1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
    Salt and pepper to taste
    1 tablespoon olive oil
    1 Honeycrisp apple, thinly sliced
    2 tablespoons honey
    Fresh parsley for garnish

### Instructions

1. Prepare the Morel Cream Sauce:
        In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.
        Add the sliced morel mushrooms and sauté until they start to brown, about 5 minutes.
        Sprinkle the flour over the mushrooms and stir to coat evenly.
        Gradually pour in the milk while stirring continuously to avoid lumps.
        Cook the sauce over low heat, stirring occasionally, until it thickens to a creamy consistency.
        Season with salt and pepper to taste. Set aside.

1. Prepare the Honeycrisp Apple Salad:
        In a mixing bowl, combine the thinly sliced Honeycrisp apple with honey.
        Toss gently to coat the apple slices evenly with honey.

1. Cook the Walleye:
        Season the walleye fillets with salt and pepper on both sides.
        Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat.
        Place the walleye fillets in the skillet and cook for about 3-4 minutes on each side until they are golden brown and cooked through.
        Remove the cooked walleye fillets from the skillet and set aside.

1. Assemble the Dish:
        Spoon the Morel Cream Sauce onto serving plates.
        Place the pan-seared walleye fillets on top of the sauce.
        Garnish with fresh parsley.
        Serve the Honeycrisp Apple Salad on the side or on top of the walleye fillets.

Enjoy the delicious combination of flavors and textures in this pan-seared walleye dish with a creamy morel sauce and refreshing Honeycrisp apple salad. It's a delightful blend of ingredients that highlights the unique qualities of each component. Bon appétit!
